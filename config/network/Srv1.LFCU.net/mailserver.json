I do not need to remind you that this is a breach of company policy as well as a serious security risk and any employees, regardless of supervisory status found to be in violation will be subject to mandatory security training as well as a formal write-up if corrective actions are not taken as soon as possible.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks,  Michael Genslinger  Security Supervisor - LFCU"
